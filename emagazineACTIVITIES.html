                    <p>Located in Indo-Pacific's Coral Triangle and boasting over 7,000 islands, the Philippines is home to some of the world's best scuba diving. With pristine coral reefs, lush coral gardens, huge schools of fish, rare critters, manta rays, and even whale sharks--there's something for everyone in the Philippines!
                        <br> <br>
                    If you’re in the Philippines, you never have to travel very far to enjoy scuba diving. Lying in the famed Coral Triangle, the country boasts a stunning array of dive spots from Luzon to Mindanao.
                        <br> <br>
                    The world-renowned Tubbataha Reef Marine Park in the Sulu Sea is the Philippines’ most famous dive spot. Divers from all over the planet flock here for liveaboard experiences exploring reefs that offer some of the highest density of marine species in the world. Other well-loved diving destinations in the Philippines one of those is

                    <p>Freediving is the close sister of scuba diving, but the two are different disciplines. When you freedive, you take to the water without the oxygen tank. Instead, you’ll have to hold your breath when you go under. Free divers can’t go as long and deep as scuba divers, but the absence of all the scuba gear means that they can be faster and nimbler in the water. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Considering that the Philippines has blistering summer temperatures and an abundance of beaches, it is no wonder that most Filipinos and visitors regard swimming and diving as a way to cool down while also enjoying the summer tropical vibe here. While swimming and scuba diving are popular beach activities in this area, few people are aware of or consider freediving as a viable alternative sport. It is not unexpected that it is not well-liked because it may catch people off guard and lead them to feel that it is a detrimental recreational activity.
                    <br> <br>
                    Recreational freediving is considered a sport, pleasure, and recreational activity. Freediving also has a number of health benefits, including increasing oxygen efficiency, increasing body strength, improving joint health, and increasing endurance and vitality.

                    <p>Generally, the best months for surf in the Philippines are August through to November. This is the best time for typhoon swells and also comes with the best winds for the quality surf breaks.
                        <br> <br>
                    You can’t talk about water sports in the Philippines without mentioning surfing. The endless coast and ready waves make the sport one of the most popular water activities in the archipelago, with plenty of surf breaks for travellers looking to catch waves. To be honest, the waves in the Philippines aren’t as massive as in other exotic surf destinations. But the spirit of the stoke is naturally alive in the islands.
                        <br>  <br>
                    Surfers are known for their love of the ocean and their laid-back, carefree attitude.
                    Surfing is often seen as a way of life, with many surfers traveling the world in search of the perfect wave.
                    In addition to being a popular recreational activity, surfing is also a competitive sport, with many professional surfers competing in contests around the world.
                    <br> <br>
                    Surfing has even been included as an Olympic sport, with the first event taking place at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
                    Overall, it's a fun and exciting sport with a rich history and culture.
                    It continues to be enjoyed by people of all ages and is a popular activity in many coastal areas around the world.
                    Some of the greatest surfers of all time have been instrumental in advancing the sport and pushing the boundaries of what is possible on a surfboard.

                    <p>Thrill-seekers, wakeboarding is one of the water sports in the Philippines you must try. Wakeboarding requires a high-speed motorboat, a cable system or other mechanism for towing a wakeboarder with such force, enabling him to do stunts including aerial flips and turns.
                        <br> <br>
                    It has all the elements you want from extreme sports: Speed, water, and even height, if you’re ready to fly over those ramps. However, the extensive equipment required means the wakeboarding opportunities can be quite limited.
                       <br> <br>
                    While learning any new sport is going to be difficult, wakeboarding is known to be a water sport that can be picked up quicker than many others. At first, the most important thing to learn is which foot should be the leading one. Once you figure that out it’s time to try to stand up on the board. When you are first trying to stand up on a wakeboard, put about 60% of your weight on your front foot and stay close to the board. And last but not least, know that the shorter the rope, the easier it is to handle. Wakeboarding beginners should keep their tow rope short and the tow handle low down on their body.

                    <p>Kitesurfing is a beast! Not only do you have to navigate the ocean, but you’ll also have to wrestle with the wind and your kite. It’s a different experience than surfing, with kiters getting to enjoy stretches of relaxation while getting pulled by the sail. Complete beginners can try tandem kitesurfing at first, being attached to a kiting instructor just to get a feel of the sport.
                        <br> <br>
                    Kitesurfing is a mixture of many action sports like surfing, windsurfing, paragliding, and skateboarding. In its essence, kitesurfing is about riding and gliding across the water while holding onto a large hand-controlled kite that is powered by the wind. Kitesurfing is also known as kiteboarding and you don’t need waves to ride the board on the sea, wind and your board should be doing all the work. Kitesurfing is a fairly new competitive professional sport but has been around as a recreational activity since the late 1970s. 
                        <br> <br>
                    Some people find kitesurfing a little frustrating in the early stages, but you progress super quickly from the ‘total beginner’ stage to the ‘having fun’ stage. However, you need to learn with the right gear (a suitable kite, board and harness), at a suitable spot and with a qualified kiteboarding instructor.

                    <p>Can’t surf the “shore break?” Well, these waters are perfect for skimboarding. Instead of paddling out like surfers, skimboarders start at the sandy beach, glide over the water into the ocean, and then ride the breaking waves back to shore. Fresh beginners typically just skim across the shoreline for as long as they can, instead of going into the water.
                        <br> <br>
                    The Philippines boasts a crazy abundance of sandy beaches, so it’s not surprising that there are also a couple of amazing skimming spots in the country. You’ll want to look for long and flat shores, with no corals or seaweed that can prevent the board from sailing smoothly on the shoreline.
                        <br> <br>
                    Boracay’s famous White Beach is a fantastic skimming spot, probably one of the best spots in the country to learn the sport. Most skimmers venture out to play around sunset.

                    <p>Not a fan of extreme sports? Standup paddleboarding is one of the more leisurely water sports in the Philippines, an activity that isn’t too crazy of an adrenaline rush. That said, it’s still a workout! If you’re on the board for hours, expect a bit of soreness in your arms, back, and core when you wake up the next day.
                        <br> <br>
                    Paddleboarding is possible in any body of water, from lakes to rivers to the sea. But while you can enjoy the sport practically anywhere in the Philippines, we recommend actually paddling somewhere for sightseeing! 
                        <br> <br>
                    Stand-up paddleboarding, also known for the acronym SUP, is one of the fastest-growing boardsports in the world.
                    Stand-up paddleboards are also used by yoga, pilates, fishing, and swimming enthusiasts to perform specific training.

                    <p>Like paddleboarding, kayaking is one of the water sports that you can enjoy as part of a tour. Hop on a kayak, then row away to coves, nearby isles, or even just open water. Practically every beach in the Philippines will have kayaks lying by the beach, and river tours on kayaks are also pretty common.
                        <br> <br>
                    Kayaking is a fun water sport. It involves the use of a kayak, a narrowboat with a double-blade paddle to move on water. The driver is supposed to navigate through the waterways by sitting face-forward and marching ahead with alternating side-to-side paddle strokes.
                        <br> <br>
                    Kayaking was originally invented for hunting. It was even used to hunt fish or transport passengers across the water. But later, it was essentially used for recreation purposes or in competitive sporting events around the globe.
                        <br> <br>
                    Kayaking is a low impact activities that can improve your aerobic fitness, strength and flexibility. Specific health benefits include: Improved cardiovascular fitness. Increased muscle strength, particularly in the back, arms, shoulders and chest, from moving the paddle.

                    <p>Parasailing means putting on a harness with a parachute and get pulled by a boat and fly high into the air. It is a gentle takeoff but it will get your adrenaline pumping. Adrenaline helps boost your immune system and get your heart rate up which improves your cardiovascular health overall.
                        <br> <br>
                    This may seem like a calm activity, especially to adrenaline junkies who are addicted to extreme sports, but being harnessed to a parachute-like canopy while being towed by a speed boat isn’t for the faint of heart. Imagine flying a kite high up in the air. Now, imagine that you are the kite. Doesn’t that sound thrilling to you?
                        <br> <br>
                    Parasailing can be practiced by anybody, as it does not require any specific skill except the ability to swim. As the flight winds down, the person attached to the parachute ends up in the water, which is considered the safest way to stop a ride. People who are afraid of heights should also be wary, as some flights are done up to 2,000 feet (610 m) off the ground. As the person is attached to the parachute with a harness, the risk of injury is minor, allowing both children and older people to enjoy the sport. The youngest person on record to go parasailing was 9; the oldest, 87.
