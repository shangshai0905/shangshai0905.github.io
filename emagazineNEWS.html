                                                MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Tourism (DOT) is hoping to position the Philippines as a “regional cruise center” in Asia as it expects the number of cruise ships docking in the country in 2023 to surpass pre-pandemic levels.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                “We will develop the Philippines as a major regional cruise center in Asia that supplies not only cruise ship experiences but also crew training, crewing, cruise line business outsourcing, and cruise ship maintenance services in Asia,” Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco said in a statement on Wednesday, February 15. 
                                                <br> <br>
                                                After hundreds of passengers aboard the cruise ship Silver Spirit alighted in Manila, Frasco announced that 139 cruise ships are expected to dock in the country this year, a 36.27% increase from 2019.

                                                <br> <br>
                                                The Silver Spirit was the third cruise ship to arrive in the country for the year, carrying 317 guests and 415 crew, after the cruise calls of the Seabourn Encore with 512 passengers and 482 crew, and Silver Shadow with 320 passengers and 288 crew.

                                                Just a day before Valentine’s, the international cruise ship MV Seabourn Encore arrived in Boracay from Singapore.
                                                Hosting almost 600 tourists and 500 crew members, the ship stayed on the island for eight hours so that visitors could tour the beaches, souvenir shops, and restaurants.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                “Way back during our pre-pandemic, they used to be our regular clients and they added to our tourist arrival. We are happy that at least, they have returned,” says Malay tourism officer Felix Gregorio Delos Santos.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                The MV Seabourn Ovation, one of the cruise line’s other ships, was originally set to arrive in February 2020. However, the trip was canceled due to the rising cases of COVID-19.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                The last recorded cruise ship in Boracay was in 2018. This year, the popular tourist destination is expecting visits from at least 18 cruise ships, with more set to arrive until 2025.
                                                Delos Santos estimated the island’s daily tourist arrival from 5,000 to 6,000. “In January, we have reached 177,000 and hopefully it will increase this February,” he says.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                Visiting the island destination is much easier now, since tourists only need to provide their booking information with a DOT-accredited accommodation establishment.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                Hopefully, this year will mark the upward trend of tourism in the country and the rest of the world.

                                                According to the cruise company, the guests “will relax during a private beach day on Kalanggaman Island, enjoying lunch, entertainment and plenty of time to stroll the white powdery sands of this untouched paradise.”
                                                <br> <br>
                                                “Powdery sand. Pristine waters. Warm and hospitable people. Great food. Fantastic experience. We hope these are some of the words you’ll remember after visiting us,” said the regional tourism office as it thanked the cruise ship for visiting the world-famous Kalanggaman Island.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                “We hope you’ll be back to discover more,” it added.
                                                Based on double occupancy, fares for World Cruise 2023 range from $74,000 to $278,000 per guest, it added.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                “The cruise company requested to transform the setting of the island into a festival place. Everything is being paid for by the cruise company. They just pick a specific site to do this production,” said DOT Eastern Visayas regional director Karina Rosa Tiopes in an interview.

                                                It’s been three years since cruise ships last sailed to the Philippines, but the wait is finally over as the first cruise ships have arrived in the country. Seabourn Encore had the honor of being the first cruise ship to visit the tropical paradise of Puerto Princessa in Palawan. In the coming days, cruise ships from Silversea will also visit Bohol and Ilocos Sur.

                                                The return of cruise ships is not just great news for the local economy. It also provides the thousands of Filipino crew members the opportunity to welcome guests to their own countries and show their families the cruise ships they work on for up to nine months a year

                                                <br> <br>
                                                Palawan is known for its stunning natural beauty; it is no surprise that at least 21 cruise ships will be visiting Palawan this year, bringing over 50,000 guests and crew members and significantly boosting the local economy.
                                                <br> <br>
                                                The 41,865 gross tons Seabourn Encore arrived from Singapore with around 500 guests exploring the area around Puerto Princesa. The cruise ships visited Busuanga Island today, February 10, and will also visit Manila and Boracay in the Philippines in the coming days.

                                                On February 11, Silver Shadow will visit the port of Tagbilaran on the island of Bohol. Bohol is famous for its unique ecosystems and stunning white sand beaches, making it an ideal destination for those looking to dive or enjoy the scenery. 
                                                <br> <br>
                                                Visitors will have the opportunity to tour the renowned Chocolate Hills or spend a relaxing day on the picturesque resort island of Panglao.

                                                Finally, the Silver Spirit will visit the Port of Salomague, Cabugao, Ilocos Sur, on February 14, 2023. Salomague is a fascinating destination due to its proximity to the city of Vigan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the few surviving Spanish colonial towns in the Philippines, whose original structures are largely preserved.
